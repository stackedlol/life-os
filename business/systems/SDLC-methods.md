### System Development Methodologies
- categorization with focus on problem decomposition
	- **process**-centered method: DFD (data flow diagram)
	- **data**-centered method: ERD (entity relationship diagram)
	- **object**-oriented methodology: UML diagrams

### evolution of SDLC methods
- categorization based on sequence of phases
	- *structured design*
		- waterfall development (**long delay**)
		- parallel development (**diverge and conquer**)
	- *rapid application development*
		- phased development (**useful system**)
		- system prototyping (**quick but rough**)
		- throwaway prototyping (**comprehensive but long**)
	- *agile development*
		- eXtreme programming (**pair**)
		- SCRUM (**good for smaller projects**)

### methodology selection criteria
- clarity of user requirements (agile + rapid)
- familiarity with technology
- system complexity (structured)
- system reliability (not agile)
- schedule visibility 

### more on agile (modern methods)
- agile development is suited for
	- unpredictable or dynamic requirements
	- responsible and motivated developers
	- customers who understand the process and will get involved
