### systems development lifecycle (SDLC)
- lifecycle of the information system development
- SDLC for an Information System (IS) entails
	- understanding business needs
	- designing the system to fulfill business needs
	- building the system and delivering it to user
	- analogy: designing and building a house

### I. planning phase -> PROJECT PLAN
- **project initiation**
	- project sponsor proposes a new system's idea -> system request
	- conduct feasibility analysis
		- technical feasibility
		- economic feasibility
		- organizational feasibility 
	- steering committee approves the system request

- **project management** -> *project plan*
	- develop work plan
	- staff the project
	- control and direct the project


### II. analysis phase -> SYSTEM PROPOSAL
- develop analysis strategy
	- identify problems in the current system and how new system will address it 
	- OR how the new system will fulfill desired objective
- requirement gathering
	- gather business needs of users via interviews / questionnaire
- develop business analysis models
	- describe how the new system will operate - what data and processes are needed to support new system
- get approval from steering committee for system proposal
	- system concept
	- analysis models
	- analysis strategy

### III. design phase -> SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
- develop a design strategy
- design architecture and interfaces
- develop databases and file specifications
- develop the program design
- get approval from steering committee for the system specifications 

### IV. Implementation phase -> NEW SYSTEM
- longest and most expensive phase
- system construction and testing
	- ensure system performs as designed
- system installation
	- cutover approach versus phased / parallel conversion
- post-installation

### V. Maintenance Phase -> MAINTENANCE PLAN
- maintenance is performed for two main reasons
	1. remove software error
	2. enhance existing software

- enhance software for three reasons
	1. include additional features
	2. address business changes over time
	3. address hardware and software changes

- legacy systems - are outdated computer systems or applications still in use, often due to their critical functionality or the high cost of replacement (an example would be COBOL for banking systems)

### Phases of SDLC
- each phase of SDLC
	- series of steps/elements
	- each step has a set of techniques
	- each step has well defined deliverables
