### what is cost-volume-profit analysis
- helps managers make many important decisions such as what products and services to offer, what prices to charge, and what marketing strategy to use...'

profits are affected by:
	1. selling prices
	2. unit sales
	3. unit variable costs
	4. total fixed costs
	5. mix of products sold

- basic assumptions with CVP analysis
	- selling price is constant
	- costs are linear and can be divided into
		- variable + fixed components
	- mix of products sold remains constant

### foundational tools of CVP analysis
1. the contribution approach income statement
	- separates costs into variable and fixed categories
	- contribution margin - is the amount remaining from sales after variable expenses have been deducted 

2. variable expense and contribution margin ratios
	-  variable expense ratio - expresses variable expensed as a percentage of sales

3. the profit equations
	- (sales - variable expenses) - fixed expenses
