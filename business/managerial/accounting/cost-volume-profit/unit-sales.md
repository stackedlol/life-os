### how do unit sales affect contribution margin and net operating income?
- can use profit equations from [[cvp-analysis]]
	- (P x Q - V X Q) - fixed expenses
	- unit CM x Q - fixed expenses
	- CM ratio x Sales - fixed expenses

### operating leverage
- is a measure of how sensitive net operating income is to a given percentage change in unit sales
- degree of operating leverage = contribution margin / net operating income

### break-even analysis
- break-even point - is the level of sales at which profit is zero

### margin of safety
- equals total budgeted (or actual) sales minus break-even sales
	- the higher the margin of safety, the lower the risk of not breaking even and incurring a loss

### the sales mix
- refers to the relative proportions in which a company's products are sold... the goal is to achieve the combination, or mix, that yields the greatest profits
