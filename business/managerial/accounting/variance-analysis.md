### what is variance analysis?
- helps managers compare actual performance vs. budgeted performance
- it identifies why there's a difference
	- is it a price (cost) issue?
	- or an efficiency (usage) issue?
- the goal is to find and fix the causes of cost differences

1. Planning Budget vs. Flexible Budget
	- planning budget - prepared before the period begins using expected activity levels
	- flexible budget - adjusted for the actual level of activity that occurred
	- variances how how much performance differed because of activity level changes 

2. revenue and spending variances
	- revenue variance - difference between actual and expected sales revenue
	- spending variance - difference between actual and budgeted costs
	- helps identify where the company spent more or less than planned 

3. materials price and quantity variance
	- price variance - difference between actual cost per unit of material and the standard (expected) cost
	- quantity variance - difference between actual material used and the standard quantity allowed for production

4. labor rate and efficiency variances
	- rate variance - difference between actual hourly wage rate and the standard rate
	- efficiency variance - difference difference between actual hours worked and the standard hours allowed

5. variable overhead rate and efficiency variances
	- rate variance - difference between actual variable overhead cost per hour and the standard rate
	- efficiency variance - measures how efficiently the activity based (labor hours) was used

6. fixed overhead budget and volume variances
	- budget variance - difference between actual fixed overhead and the budgeted fixed overhead
	- volume variance - difference between budgeted and applied fixed overhead (based on production volume)

- broken down into favorable and unfavorable
	- favorable - lower cost or higher revenue
	- unfavorable - higher cost or lower revenue
