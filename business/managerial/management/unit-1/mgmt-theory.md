### what is management theory


### classical viewpoint
- emphasized finding ways to manage work more efficiently, assumed that people are rational 

	- **scientific** - improving productivity on individual workers
	- **administrative**  - total organization's productivity and efficiency 

- tends to be too mechanistic... viewing humans as cogs within a machine, instead of actual human needs

### scientific management
- applied scientific principles to improve the productivity of individual workers
	1. evaluate a task by scientifically studying each part... establish realistic performance goals for a job
	2. carefully select workers with the right abilities
	3. give workers the training and incentives to do the task with the proper work methods
	4. use scientific principles to plan the work methods and ease the way for workers to do their jobs

### administrative management
- is concerned with managing the total organization productivity and efficiency

	> charles Clint Spaulding, Henri Fayol, Max Weber


### behavioral viewpoint
- emphasized the importance of understanding human behavior and of motivating employees toward achievement
	- **early behaviorism**
	- **the human relations movement** ([[human-relations]])
	- **behavioral science**


### quantitive management
- application of quantitative techniques such as statistic and computer simulations, to management 

	- **operations management**
		- focused on managing the production and delivery of an organizations products or services more effectively
		- manages the supply chain
		- it governs manager's decisions about how to increase productivity and efficiency, as well as how to achieve the highest possible quality of both goods and services

	- **evidence-based management** 
		- translating principles based on best evidence into organizational practice, bringing rationality to the decision making process 

### systems viewpoint
- view an organization as a collection of subsystems

	- **closed system:** has little interaction with its environm. ent; that is, it focused exclusively on the organization's inner workings

	- **open system:** continually interacts with its environment... potential of producing synergy

	- **complexity theory:** the study of how order and pattern arise from very complicated, apparently chaotic systems 


### contingency viewpoint
- emphasized that a manger's approach should vary according to the individual and the environmental situation 

### individuals who helped pioneer administrative theory
- **Charles Spaulding** - proposed the "necessities of management"
	- the need for authority
	- division of labor
	- adequate capital
	- proper budgeting
	- cooperation + teamwork

> enriching the lives of his organizational and community family while focusing on making a profit

- **Henri Fayol**
	- identifying the major functions of management
		- planning
		- organizing
		- leading
		- controlling

- **Max Weber**
	- believed a bureaucracy was a rational, efficient, ideal organization based on principles of logic
		- improve organizational productivity and efficiency
		- reducing ambiguity
			1. defining a hierarchy of authority
			2. detailing a clear division of labor
			3. documenting formal rules and procedures
	- huge influence on the structure of large corporations, by identifying principles that improve organizational consistency and efficiency

- **Mary Parker Follett** - power sharing
	- believed organizations should become more democratic, with managers and employees working cooperatively
		1. organizations should be operated as communities
		2. managers and workers talk over differences... integration
		3. work process should be under the control relevant knowledge, rather than of managers who instead should act as facilitators
	- enabled self-managed teams, worker empowerment, and interdepartmental teams

- **Elton Mayo** - *Hawthorne Effect*
	- employees worked harder when they received added attention, or paid special attention to them

- Taylor & Gilbreths
