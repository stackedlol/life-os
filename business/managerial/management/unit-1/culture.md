### hofstede's model of four cultural dimensions
- **individualism/collectivism** - people are expected to take care of themselves

- **power distance** - the degree to which people accept inequality in social situations

- **uncertainty avoidance** - people's intolerance for uncertainty and risk
	- how much a society relies on social norms and procedures to make future events more predictable

- **masculinity/femininity** - expresses how much people value performance-oriented traits


### the GLOBE project
- is a massive ongoing cross cultural investigation of nine cultural dimensions involved in leadership and organizational processes

### time orientation
- monochronic time - doing one thing at a time...
- polychronic time - doing more than one thing at a time...


### culture context
- low-context: shared meanings are primarily derived from written and spoken words
- high-context: in which people rely heavily on situational and nonverbal cues for meaning when communicating with others
