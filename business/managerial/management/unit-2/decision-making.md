### two kinds of decision making...
1. RATIONAL
2. NON-RATIONAL
### rational model of decision making
- proposed by *Adam Smith*
- assumes people make rational decisions based on analysis of all potential outcomes

1. identify the problem or opportunity
2. think up alternative solutions
3. evaluate alternatives & select a solution
	- is it ethical?
	- is it feasible?
	- is it effective?
4. implement & evaluate the solution chosen
	- plan carefully
	- be sensitive to those affected

### non-rational decision making
- assumes that decision making is nearly always uncertain and risky

	- **satisficing model** - managers seek alternatives until they find one that is satisfactory, not optimal
- 
	- **intuition model** - making a choice without the use of conscious thought or logical inference 

- Herbert Simon proposed that managers could not act purely logically because their rationality was bounded by so many restrictions (**bounded rationality**)
	- suggests that decision makers' ability to be rational is limited by numerous constraints...
		- complexity
		- time
		- money
		- values
		- skills
		- habits
		- personality
		- unconscious reflexes
