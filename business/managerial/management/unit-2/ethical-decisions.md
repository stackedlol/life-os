> ties in with [[ethics]]
### what causes growth in ethical lapses?
- **organizational-level factors** - poor board oversight, performance-crazed cultures, and unclear role expectations.

- **group-level factors** - an intense commitment to the organization's mission, vision, and values, pressure to conform to other's expectations, and a highly political environment all can lead to unethical behaviors 

- **individual-level factors** - a leader's personality and social characteristics such as narcissism, hubris, and power can contribute to unethical leadership 

### five reasons for unethical firings
1. the public is "less forgiving" of poor behavior by executives
2. regulations are more stringent
3. companies are expanding operations into developing countries
4. digital communication increase exposure to risk from both hackers and whistle-blowers
5. the 24/7 news cycle and the proliferation of media in the 21st century
