### the eight organizational structures...
1.  traditional designs

	- simple - has authority centralized in a single person

	- functional - people with similar occupational specialities are together in formal groups

	- divisional - people with diverse occupational specialities are put together in formal groups by similar products or services, customers or clients, or geographic regions

	- matrix structures - combines functional and divisional chains of command in a grid... vertical and horizontal

2.  horizontal designs - team-based design, team or workgroups used to improve collaboration and work on shared tasks by breaking down internal boundaries


3.  designs the open boundaries

	- hollow - often called the network structure, the organization has a central core of key functions and outsources other functions to vendors who can do them cheaper or faster

	- modular - a firm assembles product chunks, or modules, provided by outside contractors

	- virtual structures - employees are geographically spread apart, usually co-working through remote working software
