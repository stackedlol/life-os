### organizational culture has 3 levels:
1. observable artifacts
	- visible behavior exhibited by managers and employees
	- easiest element of culture to influence
2. espoused values
	- explicitly stated values and norms preferred by an organization 
	- mission, vision, and value statements
3. basic assumptions
	- represent the general connotation of the industry

### how employees learn culture...
- SYMBOLS
- STORIES
- HEROS
  RITES & RITUALS

### organizational socialization
- the process by which people learn values, norms, and required behaviors that permit them to participate as members of an organization:

	1. Anticipatory socialization phase - before entry into the organization, usually external influence from web sources

	2. Encounter Phase - inception at point of hire usually referred to as onboarding

	3. change and acquisition phase - develop a strong sense of your work role performed through goal settings and feedback

### four types of organizational culture
1. clan -  internal focus and values flexibility rather than stability and control aka "family"

2. adhocracy - external focus and values flexibility, commonly found in startups to foster innovation

3. market - strong external focus and values stability and control

4. hierarchy - internal focus and values stability and control over flexibility

organizational effectiveness varies long two dimensions 
- the horizontal dimension - internal vs external
- the vertical dimension - order vs chaos
