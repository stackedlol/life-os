### the major features of an organization

- Barnard's classic perspective of organization: as a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or more people

- Schein proposed that all organizations can be described according to four features:

	1. common purpose
		- unifies employees or members and gives everyone an understanding of the organization's reason for being
	2. coordinated effort
		- the coordination of individual efforts into a group or organization-wide effort 
	3. division of labor
		- work specialization, is the arrangement of having discrete parts of a task done by different people
	4. hierarchy of authority
		- or chain of command, is a control mechanism for making sure the right people do the right things at the right time
		- utilize unity of command to avoid conflicting priorities and demands

### types of organizations
- flat organization - is defined as one with an organizational structure with few or no levels of middle management between top managers and those reporting to them


### authority agreement
1. span of control
	- refers to the number of people reporting directly to a given manager (either narrow or wide)
2. authority, responsibility, and delegation
	- rights inherent in a managerial position to make decisions, give orders, and utilize resources
	- delegation is the process of assigning managerial authority and responsibility to managers and employees lower in hierarchy 
3. centralization versus decentralization of authority
	- centralized authority - important decisions made by higher level mangers only
	- decentralized authority - important decisions are made by middle-level and supervisory-level managers
