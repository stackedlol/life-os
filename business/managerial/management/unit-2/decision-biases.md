### decision making biases
- **heuristics** - strategies that simplify the process of making decisions

### the ten common biases
- **availability** - the use of information readily available form memory to make judgements (not the FULL PICTURE)

- **representativeness** - the tendency to generalize from a small sample or single event (happening once and again)

- **confirmation** - when people seek information to support their point of view and discount data that does not support it

- **sunk cost** - occurs when managers add up all the time, money, and effort for a project and don't abandon it (producing a product for too long)

- **anchoring and adjustment** - the tendency to make decisions based on an initial standard or number (irrelevant to market realities)

- **overconfidence** - people's subjective confidence in their decision making is greater than the objective 

	1.  take credit for good outcomes and deflect blame for bad outcomes
	2. have overly positive memories about their past performance
	3. be overly optimistic about future events that lead to positive outcomes
	4. presume they have more control over the outcome than they actually do

- **hindsight** - tendency for people to view events as more predictable than they really are

- **framing** - tendency of decision makers to be influenced by the way a situation or problem is presented to them

- **escalation of commitment** - whereby decision makers increase their commitment to a project despite negative information about it (fixated on future gains)

- **categorical thinking** - the tendency of decision makers to classify people or information based on observed or inferred characteristics (can lead to stereotypes and prejudices)
