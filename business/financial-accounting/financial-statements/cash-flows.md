### What is the balance sheet?
- shows the company's financial position at a specific point in time (like a snapshot)
- you can compare two balance sheets to see how much cash changed
- it doesn't explain **WHY** cash changed

### What is an income statement? 
- shows the net income (profit) over a time period
- doesn't show cash directly (just **revenues** and **expenses**)
- sometimes broken down into a [[multi-income-statement]]

### why a statement of cash flow is needed...
- to explain how and why cash changed during the period
- it fills in the blanks that the balance sheet and income statement don't cover


### breaking down the cash flow statement
i. operating activities
- day-to-day business operations
- cash from selling products/services or paying for expenses like rent, salaries, etc
ii. investing activities 
- buying or selling long-term stuff (equipment, property, investments)
- cash used *to grow* the business
iii. financing activities
- cash from investors or loans, or paying dividends
- cash to fund the business (from outside sources)

### how to prepare operating activities
- in-direct method: starts with net income (from income statement)
	- adjusts for depreciation
	- adjusts for changes in [[accounts-receivable]], [[inventory]], etc.

- direct method: lists all cash coming in (from customers) and cash going out (like rent, salaries)
	- more straight forward, but less commonly used
