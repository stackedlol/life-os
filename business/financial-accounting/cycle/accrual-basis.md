### revenue recognition for accrual accounting
- In the period goods and services are provided to customers
- In the period cost are presumed to have been used in operations
- part of [[GAAP]] (**REQUIRED**)

### quick rule of thumb
- Under accrual-basis accounting...
	-  record **revenues** when *we provide goods and services to customers*
	-  record **expenses** when costs are *used in company operations*

### accrued revenue/expenses
- whenever revenue/expenses come before cash

1. accrued revenue: earn revenue before cash is received (sell goods or services on account... impact accounts receivable)
2. accrued expense: incur an expense before cash is paid (purchase on account... impacts accounts payable)
