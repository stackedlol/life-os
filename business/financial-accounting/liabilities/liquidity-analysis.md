### what is liquidity analysis
- liquidity analysis evaluates a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its current assets. It helps assess financial health and operational efficiency. 

### key concepts:
1. **Liquidity** - the ability to convert assets into cash quickly without significant loss in value

2. **Current Assets** - short-term assets that can be converted into cash within a year (e.g. cash, accounts receivable, inventory)

3. **Current Liabilities** - obligations due within a year (e.g. accounts payable, short-term debt, wages payable)

### three liquidity measures:

4. **working capital:**
	- working capital = current assets - current liabilities
	- measure of current assets remaining after paying current liabilities
	- a large positive working capital is an indicator of liquidity
	- not the best measure of liquidity for comparing across companies, because the ratio does not control  for relative size of each company

5. **current ratio** 
	- current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
	- the amount of current assets available for every $1 of current liabilities 
	- the higher the current ratio, the greater the company's liquidity
	- A current ratio of say 1.5 indicates that for every dollar of current liabilities, the company has $1.5 of current assets

6. **acid-test ratio**
	- acid-test ratio = cash + current investments + accounts receivable / current liabilities
	- the amount of "quick assets" available for every $1 of current liabilities
	- by excluding less liquid current assets, the acid-test ratio may provide a better overall indication of a company's liquidity

### liquidity management
- management can influence the ratios that measure liquidity to some extent
- a company can influence the timing of inventory and accounts payable recognition by asking suppliers to delay delivery schedules from December to January. This would reduce balances in inventory and accounts payable, thus changing the current ratio.
