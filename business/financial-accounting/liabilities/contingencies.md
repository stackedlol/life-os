> a contingent liability and the associated loss is recorded fi the loss is both probable and can be estimated

### contingent [[liability]]
- an existing uncertain situation that **might** result in a loss depending on the outcome of a future event.

### criteria for reporting contingent liabilities
- the likelihood of payment is
	- ***probable*** -- likely to occur
	- ***reasonably possible*** -- more than remote but less than probable
	- ***remote*** -- the chance is slight 

- the amount of payment is
	- reasonably estimate
	- not reasonably estimate

- a contingent liability is recorded only if... a loss is ***probable*** and the amount is ***reasonably estimate***

### contingent gains
 - An existing uncertain situation that might result in a gain
 - In a lawsuit, the defendant faces a contingent liability, while the other side - the plaintiff - has a contingent gain 
 - contingent gains are not recorded until the gain is certain
 

### examples of contingent liabilities:
- **lawsuits:** if a company is being sued and it is likely to lose, a liability is recorded

- **product recalls:** if a defect is found in a product and lawsuits may follow, a potential liability is considered.

- **loan guarantees:** if a company guarantees a loan for another party, it is contingent on the other party's default
