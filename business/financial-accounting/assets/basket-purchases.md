### what is a basket purchase?
- purchase of more than one asset at the same time for one purchase price
	- example: purchase land , building, and equipment together for $900,000
- because we need to record [[land]], [[buildings]], and [[equipment]] in separate accounts, we must allocate the total purchase price based on the **relative fair values** of the individual assets.
