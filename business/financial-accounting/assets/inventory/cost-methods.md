#accounting uses four generally accepted inventory methods:
1. specific identification:
	- matches each unit of inventory with its actual cost
2. #weighted-average-cost
	- assumes each unit of inventory has a cost equal to the weighted-average unit cost of all inventory items
3. first-in, first-out ( #FIFO ) cost
	- assumes first units purchased are first ones sold
4. last-in, first-out ( #LIFO ) cost
	- assumes last units purchased are first ones sold

- companies can use any of those four methods above
- methods can have very different effects on reported in your [[financial-statements]]:
	- profits
	- income taxes
	- cash flow
