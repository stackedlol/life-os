### choice of inventory reporting methods
- accounting method selected affects the
	- profits to be reported
	- amount of income tax to be paid
	- values of inventory turnover and gross profit ratios derived from the [[financial-statements]]

### reporting via certain [[cost-methods]]
- #FIFO method:
	- matches physical flow for most companies
	- ending inventory reflects current cost
	- #balance-sheet  approach
- #LIFO method (tax advantageous... can reinvest): 
	- cost of goods sold reflects current cost
	- #income-statement approach
- LIFO conformity rule:
	- companies that use LIFO for tax reporting must also use the LIFO for financial reporting (on [[financial-statements]])
