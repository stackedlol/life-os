> the cost of inventory **not yet sold** at the end of the period
### inventory and cost of goods
- the heart of any retail business and cost of goods sold
- companies sue two systems:
	1. [[periodic-inventory]] system - update inventory at set intervals (monthly, quarterly, annually)

	2. [[perpetual-inventory]] system - keeps accurate records as it updates the inventory account for each purchase and each sale and the cost of goods (preferred by bigger businesses, but tech made it available to small)

### inventory cost flow assumption:
- accounting methods used to assign costs to the goods that a company sells (Cost of Goods Sold - **COGS**)
- Helps determine which costs are "charged" to COGS and which costs remain on the #balance-sheet as ending inventory
- Important because the physical flow of goods often doesn't match the flow of costs (WHY?)


- [[GAAP]] permits a company to pick between three cost flow assumptions:
	1. #FIFO - assumes that the first items added to inventory (the oldest costs) are sold first (worse for taxes)

	2. #LIFO - assumes that the most recently acquired items (the newest costs) are sold first. (better for taxes)
		- can result in a lower ending inventory value during times of rising prices, as newer, higher-cost items are expensed first

	3. #weighted-average-cost - this method averages out all costs of goods available for sale over the period


- selection of the inventory cost flow assumption can have  IMPORTANT implications for the amount of #net-income that a company reports on the income statement and their tax liability.

### financial ratios involved with inventory:
2. **GROSS PROFIT RATIO** - a key indicator of a company's ability to sell inventory at a profit (important for [[stock-analysis]])

3. **INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO** - measures how quickly a company sells its inventory (important indicator of the company's ***ABILITY*** to sell its products)

 >sum of all costs incurred to bring the inventory to salable condition
### what makes up the cost of inventory
- purchase price
- freight in
- insurance while in transit
- fees or taxes paid to get the inventory ready to sell
- less returns, allowances, and discounts 

### inventory between manufacturing and merchandising companies

- **manufacturing company:** purchase raw materials from suppliers and hire employees to work and produce inventory
	- raw materials
	- work in process
	- finished goods

- **merchandising company:** buys inventory from a **supplier**
	- wholesaler
	- retailer
