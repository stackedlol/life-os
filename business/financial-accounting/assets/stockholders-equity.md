### what is stockholder's equity?
- Stockholder's equity represents the stockholders' ownership interest in the assets of the corporation. Stockholders' equity is divided into two components: 
	i. **paid in capital** (contributed capital... stock accounts)
	ii. **retained earnings**

### types of stock
- common stock
	- basic ownership in a company
	- comes with voting rights and the potential to get dividends (last in line if the company goes bankrupt)
- preferred stock
	- gets paid before common stockholders
	- usually receives fixed dividends
	- no voting rights

### par value vs. no par value
- **par value**: a tiny value assigned when a company is formed ($0.01)
	- legal protection - stock can't be sold below par
- **no par value**: no set amount, but some states make companies assign a "stated value" that works just like par

### treasury stock
- treasury stock is when a company buys back its own stock
- it's recorded as negative amount (contra-equity)

### dividends
- cash dividends
	- company needs enough retained earnings and cash
	- board of directors must approve
	- once declared it's a legal obligation
- stock dividends
	- company gives out more shares instead of cash
	- retained earnings go down, stock account goes up

### stock splits
- a stock split increases the number of shares and lowers the price per share
- no change in total equity
- just makes the stock more affordable or appealing
