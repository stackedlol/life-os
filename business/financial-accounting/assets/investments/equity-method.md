### key concepts of the equity method...
- significant influence: 
	- when an investor owns between 20%-50% of another company's stock, it is presumed to have significant influence over that company.
- recording net income: 
	- the investor recognizes its share of the funded company's net income -- even if that income isn't received as cash. 
	- this is done by increasing (debting) the investment account and recognizing the income (crediting an equity income account)
- dividends: 
	- if dividends are received later, they are recorded as a reduction in the investment account rather than as income because the income was already recognized.
