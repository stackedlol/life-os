### goodwill as an asset...
- goodwill is the portion of the purchase price that exceeds the fair value of identifiable net assets
- recorded only when one company acquires another company
- net assets = assets acquired less liabilities assumed
- most companies also create goodwill to some extent through advertising, employee training, and other efforts. However as it does for other internally generate intangibles, a company must expense costs incurred in the internal generation of goodwill
