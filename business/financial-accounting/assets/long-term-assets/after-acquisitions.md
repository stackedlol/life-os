### general rules for after acquisition...
- capitalize all costs (add to the cost of the [[assets]]) incurred prior to the [[assets]] being used
- capitalize an expenditure after the asset has been placed in service if it meets one of the following three requirements
	- increase useful life
	- increases capacity
	- litigation costs to successfully defend [[intangible-assets]]
- expenditures that are ordinary maintenance or maintain normal working order should be expensed when incurred.

### materiality
- an item is said to be material if it is large enough to influence a decision
- when an expenditure is not material, the item is typically recorded as an expense regardless of its expected period of benefit
- companies generally have policies regarding amounts that are not material. They will expense all costs under a certain dollar amount, say $1000, regardless of whether future benefits are increased
