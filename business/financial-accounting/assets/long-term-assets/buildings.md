### buildings as an asset...
- buildings include adminstriative offices, retail sotres, manufacturing facilities, and storage warehouses.
- costs of getting a building ready for use include items such as
	- relator commissions and legal fees 
- remodeling costs
- unique accounting issues arise when a firm constructs a building rather than purchasing it (capitalize interest cost)
