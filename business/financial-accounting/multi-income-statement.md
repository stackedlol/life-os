### the flow
1. calculate net sales = revenue - contra revenue
2. subtract cost of goods sold (cost of inventory) to get **gross profit**
3. from gross profit your will subtract your operating expenses
4. then from **operating income** +/- other revenue (interest)
5. after that you get income before taxes
6. subtract your tax expense to get **NET INCOME**

### architecture of the statement
- reports multiple levels of profitability

1. gross profits = net revenues - [[cost-of-goods-sold]]
2. operating income = gross profit - operating expenses
3. income before taxes = operating income + non-operating revenues - non-operating expenses
4. net income = all revenues - all expenses
