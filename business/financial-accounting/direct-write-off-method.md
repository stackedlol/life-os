> write off bad debts only at the time they actually become #uncollectible-account(s)

- unlike the [[allowance-method]], which requires estimation of #uncollectible-account(s) before they even occur.

### when is this method used?
- when #uncollectible-account(s) are not anticipated or are inmmaterial
- primarily used for tax reporting
- reminder... not permitted under [[GAAP]]

### [[allowance-method]] vs direct write off
- allowance account is credited for the estimate and debited for the actual write off (balance cancels)
- wait until it is deemed uncollectible (after period of sale)

### overview of this method...
- the direct write-off method waits to reduce accounts receivable and record bad debt expense until accounts receivable prove collectible in the future. This leads to accounts receivable being overstate in the current year. 
- overstates [[assets]] on the balance sheet since [[accounts-receivable]] are reported at full amount
- Improper matching of the bad debt expense to the sales revenue
