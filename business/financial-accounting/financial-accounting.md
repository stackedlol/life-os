### activities that financial accounting measures

mock situation

> The company needs 300,000 to start the business... they need investors and creditors to exchange funds for a shares and loans

> assume 200,000 from investors and a 100,000 loan with a 12% interest rate... assume there is 120,000 in equipment and 180,000 in cash

Breaking down the activities...

**FINANCING ACTIVITIES**: Transactions the company has with investors and creditors

**INVESTING ACTIVITIES**: Transactions involving purchase and sale of *resources* (long-term assets, property, plant, and equipment) that are expected to benefit the company for several years.

**OPERATING ACTIVITIES**: Transactions that relate to the primary operations of the company. (paying employees and selling goods + services)

### what are people LOOKING for?
- the accounting equation:

> ASSETS = Liabilities (creditor claims) + Stockholder's Equity (owner's claims)

*Assets* - resources of the company (provide a future BENEFIT)
*Liabilities* - creditor's claims to resources 
*Stockholder's Equity* - owner's claim to resources

- investors and creditors want to see sources and claims to resources

- accounting equation is always in balance
