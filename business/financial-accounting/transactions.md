### effects of transactions on the basic accounting  equation
- a transaction is a recorded event that has a financial impact on the business and can be measured (usually [[external-transactions]])
- it will have a dual effect on the [[financial-accounting]] equation

GENERAL RULES
- if total assets **increase**, then liabilities or stockholder's equity **increases** by the same amount
- if total assets **decrease**, then liabilities or stockholder's equity **decreases** by the same amount

### understanding effects of transactions...

1. What accounts are affected by the transaction?
2. Is the account an asset, liability, or stockholder's equity
3. Does the account increase or decrease?
4. Do assets equal liabilities plus stockholder's equity?

### recurring transactions
- borrowing cash from bank: +Assets &+ Liabilities
- purchasing equipment: Assets (-Cash & +Equipment)
- pay rent in advance (prepaid): Assets (-Cash & +Prepaid)
- purchase supplies on account: +Assets & +Accounts payable (liabilities)
- provide services for cash: +Cash & +SE
- provide services on account: +AR & +RE
- Receive cash in advance from customers: +Cash & +DR
	- cannot report revenue, so it is a deferred revenue or a liability... has yet to provide services
- pay salaries to employees: -Cash & -RE (expense)
- pay cash dividends: -Cash & -RE (RE equation)

### notes payable vs. accounts payable
- notes payable: formal borrowing (from a bank)
- accounts payable: short term, no interest, and more immediate borrow
