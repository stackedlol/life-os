**what is an argument?**
- An argument is a sequence of statements
	- last claim is the conclusion
	- the other claims that allow one to infer the conclusion are premises
- premises and conclusions (ie statements) are either true or false
- arguments are either valid or invalid

**fundamentals**:
- many sentences of english are true or false
- not ALL sentences are true or false
- the only sentences that can figure into an argument are
	- truth or false
	- no questions
	- request or commands
	- exclamations

**variables**: if P then Q

**validity**:
- An argument is valid if and only if it's impossible for the premises of A to be true and the conclusion of A to be false
	- if joe gets on base, then orioles win

- **"the premises entail or imply the conclusion"**

- *Nota Bene* - the logical relation is not a causal relation
