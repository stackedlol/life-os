### what is a mcp server?
- the universal standard that lets AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources
- think of it as the level up from [[api-integration]]
- is trying to become the [[HTTP]] but for AI
### structure of mcp
1. MCP hosts
	- the AI application you're actually using
2. MCP servers
	- small programs that expose specific capabilities to AI
	- receives requests from the AI host and actually performs the actions
3. transport layer
	- how the host and server communicate
### what does mcp provide?
- resources (reading data)
- tools (functions the AI can call to do things)
