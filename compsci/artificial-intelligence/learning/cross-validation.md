> NOT memorizing data, but finding PATTERNS

### what is cross validation?
- the process of testing how well your model performs on unseen data
- prevents *overfitting* (memorizing training data instead of learning patterns)
- the bridge between building a model and trusting its predictions

### methods for cross validation

- train / test spit (basic method)
	- hiding data from model
	- testing model on hidden data

- k-fold (advanced method) aka 5-fold
	- spliting data into 5 equal chunks
	- get multiple opinions on data

### why cross validation?
- prevents overfitting
- deletes false confidence
