### what are graphs in DSA?
- nodes connected by edges (can be directed or undirected)

### how do we use graphs in DSA...
- DFS (depth first search) - explore one path all the way before backtracking
- BFS (breadth first search) - explore layer by layer, good for shortest path
- shortest path algorithms - Dijkstra;s, Bellman-Ford, A*
