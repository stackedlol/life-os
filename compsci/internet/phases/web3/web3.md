### Overall Concept
A future in which the majority of the applications/platforms/networks used by people on the internet are *NOT* **centralized** and run by big tech companies; but rather, **decentralized** protocols built on top of blockchains and collectively governed by the user base.

> An internet based on [[decentralization]] rather than having centralized powers

### Why web3?
- The previous architecture... web2 is "reaching" a peak + decline
	- web2 has generated trillions in market value
	- **power** has also been concentrated in certain industries:
		- Finance, Social Media, Government
		- web2 has been used to *increase* **power**

### Visualizing web3

### The Origins of web3
- One of the catalyst events for web3 was the 2008 market crash.
	- reckless investment tactics (**Finance**) enabled by the **US Government**.

- Another catalyst, **Social Media**, had come to power and was dominated by a couple of players. These players (companies) have the power to unilaterally censor or deplatform whoever they seem fit. 
	- Creators (users that provide incentive to use the platform) are under-compensated too.

> In the wake of the crash, *The Bitcoin Whitepaper* was written in the wake of this financial disaster and offered an alternative that was based on hard money and incorruptible technology.
