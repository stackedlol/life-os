### AArch64
- stands for ARM architecture 64-bit
- ARM = processors designed for efficiency and low power usage
- commonly found in mobile devices, raspberry pi, embedded systems, and in [[cloud-computing]] servers
- uses RISC (reduced instruction set computing) which means simpler instructions, faster execution per watt

### RISC-V (version 5 RISC)
- open-source CPU architecture
- like ARM, uses RISC principles

### x86
- a classic intel instruction set architecture
- originally 32-bit
- runs on older PCs, servers, and some lightweight environments
- still exists in legacy systems you may encounter 

### x86_64 + AMD64
- 64 bit extension of x86, originally created by AMD
- standard for most modern desktops, laptops, and servers
- can run both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit apps
- is the **dominant** server architecture in data centers today
