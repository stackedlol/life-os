### infrastructure as a service
- the most flexible category of cloud services (maximum control)
	- responsible for maintaining:
		- hardware
		- network connectivity
		- physical security
- essentially renting the hardware in the cloud datacenter, but what you do with the hardware is up to you

### lift and shift migration:
- you're setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving things to running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure

### testing and development:
- you have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate

### example use case of iaas
- [[virtual-machines]] are an example of iaas
