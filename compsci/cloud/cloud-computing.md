### what is cloud computing?
- is the delivery of computing services over the internet
	- this can infrastructure such as:
		- virtual machines
		- storage
		- databases
		- networking
	- can also include IoT, ML, and [[artificial-intelligence]]

> mainly used for storage and compute power

### shared responsibility model
- when you use cloud computing... the cloud provider and user share the job of keeping things safe and running

	- **consumer** - responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud 
		- information and data stored in the cloud
		- devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud
		- the accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

	- **cloud provider** - responsible for physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity
		- the physical data center
		- the physical network
		- the physical hosts

- your service model will determine responsbility for things like:
	- operating systems
	- network controls
	- applications
	- identity and infrastructure 

### cloud service types:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	- *mainly on consumer*
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- *middle ground involvement with consumer*
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- *mainly on cloud provider*

### cloud models

> defining the deployment type of cloud resources

- **private** - all servers and infrastructure are dedicated only to the company (natural evolution from corporate data center)
	- **pros:** full control, better security, custom built for needs
	- **cons:** very expensive, harder to maintain

- **public** - sharing the same server and data centers with other people/businesses (general public availability)
	- **pros:** cheap to start, no hardware, scales
	- **cons:** less control, shared resources, storage shared

- **hybrid** - mixing private cloud + public cloud and making them work together as one system
	- keep some things private
	- use public cloud for non-sensitive scalable infrastructure
	- provides the most flexibility

- **multi-cloud** - using multiple public cloud providers
	- maybe google for [[artificial-intelligence]] storage
	- maybe AWS for storage


### consumption-based-model
- when comparing IT infrastructure models... there are two types of expenses to consider

	- **Capital Expenditure** (CapEx)
		- one-time, upfront expenditure to purchase or secure resources like buying a datacenter

	- **Operational expenditure** (OpEx)
		- spending money on services or products over time like signing up for *cloud services*

> OpEx operates on a consumption based model

- a consumption based model has many benefits including:
	- No upfront costs
	- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure
	- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed
	- the ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
- no need to estimate the future resource needs
