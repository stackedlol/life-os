### Statistic basics
- purpose is to describe **data**
- central tendency - "where does the data cluster"
- variability - "how loosely or tightly bunched is the data"

### Correlation Coefficients
- Correlation tells us whether two variables are related
- range from -1 < x > 1 (always take absolute value to determine strength)
- opposite ends of spectrum indicate a perfect correlation
- explain relationship amongst data points on a scatterplot

### inferential statistics
- confidence in ability to generalize results to larger population
- look for statistical significance (a = 0.05)
	- likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is less than 5%
	- finding a false-positive result (saying there is an effect when there isn't)
- account for sample size, effect size, and variability data
- reduce confirmation bias + promote replicability
- important to keep practical significance in mind 
- inferential statistics are **PROBABILITY** based
- watch out for truncated graphs (jumped y axis)

### applications of statistics
- for exploratory **[[data-analysis]]**
	- use histograms to show frequency distribution
	- box plots for visualizing spread and outliers
	- scatter plots for understanding relationships between variables

- **hypothesis testing**
	- null hypothesis vs. alternative hypothesis
	- types of errors... type I & II
	- common tests
		- z-test and t-test for comparing means
		- chi-squared test for categorical data

- **regression analysis**
	- simple linear regression to model the relationship between two variables
	- multiple regression to include more than one predictor variable
	- assumptions of regression models
		- linearity
		- independence
		- homoscedasticity
		- normality 

- **ANOVA** - *analysis of variance*
	- one-way ANOVA to compare means across multiple groups
	- two-way ANOVE for examining the effect of two factors on a response

- non-parametric tests
	- when parametric test are not appropriate
	- examples like Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test
