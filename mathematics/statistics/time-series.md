### what is time series data?
- data collected at regular time intervals where ORDER matters

### why does time series matter?
- regular [[statistics]] assumes data points are independent
- SEQUENCE matters, dependent on previous data point

### core components of time series
1. trend - the long term direction
2. seasonality - regular predictable patterns
3. cyclical - irregular long term fluctuations
4. random/noise - unpredictable fluctuations

### applying time series 
- time series and [[cross-validation]]
	- for example, train data from Jan-June then predict test on July
