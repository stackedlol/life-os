> smooth out price noise to identify trends
### what are moving averages?
- calculates the average price of an asset over a set number of periods (day/hours/months)... by averaging prices, it filters out short-term fluctuations and reveals the underlying trend

### types of moving averages
- **simple moving average** **(SMA)**: this is a straightforward average of prices over a specified period

- **exponential moving average (EMA):** this gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information (reacts quicker to price changes than SMA)

### why use moving averages?
- trend identification - help you see whether an asset is trending upward, downward, or moving sideways

- #support & #resistance - moving averages can act as dynamic support or resistance... where prices often bounce off the moving average

- signal generation - crossovers are common signals (a shorter-term moving average cross above a longer-term average )

- they remove daily noise from price data

- shows underlying trend direction

- forms a **basis** for *most* trading signals
